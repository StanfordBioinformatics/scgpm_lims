Rehyb restart. Case #720514. (Turns out to be RTA being confused by failure of control lane.)\r\n141113_PINKERTON_0340_BC4JCDACXX - second run. Lane 5 is still control and still fails, so RTA fails calculation again. Rehyb restart, setting lane 3 as control.\r\n141117_MONK_0387_AC4JCDACXX (this record) - current run.\r\n\r\nRun works reasonably well, given that lane 3 is set as control and most lanes are overclustered. Cumulative Q30 for all lanes except 5 is in acceptable range.  FWHM fails to calc a few tiles cycle 75, 133 (lane 1), 102 (2), 111 (4-8).\r\n\r\nMarked as done 12/1/14 - CE",
